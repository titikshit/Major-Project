For our major project, we could develop an **app to identify deepfake videos** using AI-powered algorithms that analyze visual and audio inconsistencies in real-time. 
  The app would scan videos for telltale signs of manipulation, such as unnatural facial movements, speech mismatches, and irregular lighting. 
 By leveraging machine learning models trained on deepfake detection, the app could flag suspicious content, alerting users to potential misinformation. 
 Additionally, integrating a verification system with blockchain technology could allow users to cross-check the authenticity of videos against a trusted source. 
  This app would provide an easy and accessible tool to combat the growing threat of deepfake content across social media and news platforms.
