HOSTEL MANAGEMENT APP:

1. Student Profiles**: Maintain all student details like name, room number, and fee status in one place.  
2. Notice Board**: A section for wardens to post important announcements, accessible to all students.  
3. Fee Notifications**: Automated reminders for upcoming or overdue payments.  
4. Complaint Section**: Students can submit complaints directly through the app, and wardens can track and resolve them easily.  
5. Additional Features**: Optional add-ons like attendance tracking or a section for hostel rules and emergency contacts can be included later.  

The goal is to create a simple, user-friendly app that reduces manual effort and keeps everything organized for both wardens and students.
